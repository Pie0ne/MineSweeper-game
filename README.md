#Hello, this is minesweeper game that you can play in your terminal.

I made this project during codecademy course "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch".

How to play :

// To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.


// For example:


// In the command line, navigate to the compiled_js_code directory and run `node`


// Run `.load game.js` to load the contents of this file.


// Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:


// let game = new Game(5, 5, 5);


// game.playMove(0, 1);


// game.playMove(1, 2);


// When done run `.exit`
